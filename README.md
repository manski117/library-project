Make a library web app to practice using objects, forms, tables, and the DOM


**TODO List**
    -DONE make sure form actually goes to javascript and not try to go to a server by default. 
    -DONE write function that takes user input and stores itas a book object in the main array. 
    -DONE write function that loops over the library array and displays each book on the page
    -DONE tie this function to an event listener to automatically run/update when the submit or delete button is pressed.
    -DONE manipulate the table and add table items to it via the dom

    -DONE make buildTable() construct table with the growing data object
    -DONE refresh table whenever submit button is pressed.

    -DONE add delete button to books (means tying objects in array to dom) (remember to refresh table)

-DeBug: why can't I build another table after I remove ALL the book objects? 
    -DONE make form and table look pretty
    -DONE add form feedback and validation

    DONE: can we change the behavior of form inputs so that hitting "enter" does not submit the form prematurely?
