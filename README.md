# library-project
Make a library web app to practice using objects, forms, tables, and the DOM


**TODO List**
-make sure form actually goes to javascript and not try to go to a server by default. 
-write function that takes user input and stores itas a book object in the main array. 
-write function that loops over the library array and displays each book on the page
-tie this function to an event listener to automatically run/update when the submit or delete button is pressed.
-manipulate the table and add table items to it via the dom
-add delete button to books (means tying objects in array to dom)
-add toggle read button to each book display

-make form and table look pretty
-add form feedback and validation

-can we change the behavior of form inputs so that hitting "enter" does not submit the form prematurely?
